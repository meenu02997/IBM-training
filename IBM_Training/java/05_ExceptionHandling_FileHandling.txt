	- Exception handling
	- File handling


	There two children classes for Throwable:
	
		- Exception:

			- Objects with some error information
			- "Unexpection events" that can occur during the normal execution of a program
			- The exceptions can be handled and continue with the normal flow
			- If exceptions are unhandled then it will cease the program in the middle
		

			
		- Error
			- All the subclasses of the Error class in the hierarchy are errors
			- If there is an error we can't handle it with our code


	Two types of exceptions:
	
		1. Checked exceptions 

			- Identified and thrown during the compile time
			- Compiler will force to handle the checked exception

		2. Unchecked exceptions
			
			- Identified and thrown during runtime only
			- Programmer needs to sense and handle it properly
			- If unhandled will cease the program in the middle


To handle an exception in Java:

	try{} 		===> The code that can throw any excpetion will be placed in the try block
	catch{} 	===> The solution for the exception thrown will be placed in the catch bloack
	finally{} 	===> The finally block executes for sure if there is any exception or not


	try{
		//Code to open the file
		//Code to connect with the db
	}
	catch(FileNotFoundException e){
		// What to do if the file doesn't exist
	}
	catch(SQLException){
		// What to do if the db connection failed
	}


	try{
	
		//Code to connect with the db
	}
	catch(SQLException e){
		// What to do if the DB not connected
	}

- If not willing to handle the exception, we can add the throws in t method signature
- The exception can be thrown by a function by creating the appropriate exception object.

	Eg. throw new FileNotFoundException();

File Handling:

	- Accessing and manipulating the files in the hard disk from the java program is called file handling
	- Legacy File class
	- Stream based input and output classes
	- Character based input and output classes


Legacy File class:

	- Not helpful for reading and writing from a file
	- It helps controlling the file
